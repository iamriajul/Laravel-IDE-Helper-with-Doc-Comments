# Laravel IDE Helper with Doc Comments
A IDE Helper for your Laravel Project with made of only using Doc Comments.
Laravel IDE Helper/AutoComplete support for static methods.

# User with your Model
just Copy the 'Model.php' file into your \app directory and then extends your all model(that extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model) from My 'Model.php'.

Or just- Copy 'Model.php' into \app and then remove the line 'use \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;' from your models that's it!

# 'ModelAuthenticatable.php' is support for User/Login type model.
You can extends your User.php class/model from 'ModelAuthenticatable.php' to support AutoCompletion in IDE.

#*** Note: This helper tested with:
* PHPStorm

I'm not sure other IDE supports or not, but I think should support!

Always open to contribute.
Thanks.
